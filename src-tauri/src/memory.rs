//! Returns freed audio buffers to the OS on Linux.
//!
//! Each dictation allocates multi-megabyte buffers (the recording, its resampled and leveled
//! copies, the model's scratch) and frees them seconds later. glibc serves big allocations with
//! mmap and unmaps them on free, but after the first such free it raises that threshold (up to
//! 32 MB), so later buffers come from malloc's arenas. Arena memory freed by the app stays cached
//! and is never returned, so RevFly's memory grows with every dictation.
//!
//! Adapted from Handy (https://github.com/cjpais/Handy, MIT License, Copyright (c) 2025 CJ Pais),
//! which measured about 15 MB kept per 2-minute dictation, and about 0.5 MB with this fix.
//! macOS, Windows and musl don't have this problem; there both functions do nothing.

/// Pins glibc's mmap threshold so big buffers keep going back to the OS when freed. Call before
/// anything large is allocated.
